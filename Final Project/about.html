                    Seth Gundlach AKA IronApe98 enjoys having fun while gaming, but also tends 
                    to have a more strategic approach to gaming. He plays single player story 
                    games and enjoys some third person shooters. IronApe98 also occasionally 
                    enjoys a good racing game.

                <p>The History of DUDE-O's: DUDE-O's was founded by Seth Gundlach and Micah Jones. 
                    At the time, the two were playing a lot of duos in Fortnite. On August 2, 2023, 
                    Micah and Seth logged in to play another match and both had the "Dude" skin.<br><br>
                    Micah texted Seth, "I see you got Dude. You and I are now....#DudeSquad." 
                    Later that day, Seth replied, "Just duos. #dudeos." <br><br>
                    After coming up with the name, the two decided to finally pull the trigger on their idea. 
                    Unfortunately, Micah felt like he had too much on his plate and had to step away. After doing some 
                    gaming with his friend Joaquin, Seth decided to ask if he was interested in co-running the 
                    Dude-O's YouTube channel. Joaquin agreed and on November 14, 2023 that pair 
                    launched the Dude-O's YouTube channel.</p>
